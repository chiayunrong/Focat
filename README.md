# Focat

## Team Name

Focat

## Motivation

It is hard to stay focused with the abundance of applications on our mobile devices demanding our attention and, as students, it can be hard to visualise progress in your studies which is demotivating when you have spent hours studying yet nothing to show for it. By using Focat, **a gamified timer mobile application**, you can be rewarded for putting down your phone and staying focused.

Whenever you need to sit down and focus on your studies, you can start a focus session on Focat and put down your phone to focus on getting things done until the session timer runs out. Your progress will be shown on the dashboard giving you a sense of achievement after successfully completing a focus session which will also motivate you to stop procrastinating and to build upon time management habits.

Peer pressure is a powerful influence and by using Focat, users create positive feedback loops within their circle of friends by encouraging one another to sit down and focus together. With features like focus time hiscores and push notifications whenever a friend starts a focus session, users will be positively peer pressured into starting a focus session themselves or joining their friends to do so.

## Aim

We hope to replicate most of the basic features of a similar app called Forest and further improve upon it by adding features that we wanted to have when we were using the Forest app ourselves.

Instead of planting trees like in Forest, Focat will have users each raise a cat of their choice, which they can choose when they first register on the application. The more time they spend focusing, the more in-game currency rewards they will receive which can be spent on their in-game pets.

## User Stories

1. As a student who uses Forest, I wish it has many more features that cater to my needs and streamline my study process.

2. As a student who gets distracted by the social media platforms and games on my phone, I want to be able to restrict myself from using applications that I am addicted to and be rewarded for being productive.

3. As a student who does not have anyone to study with at home, I want to be able to study with my friends and have a character that is virtually there to study with me.

4. As a student who gets too engrossed when studying, I want to be able to set a stopwatch to remind myself to take a break after every study session and not overwork myself.

5. As a student who wishes to know how much time I spend on each module, I want to be able to time myself and give this duration a tag to indicate the module I was studying. This can help me to keep track of which are the modules I should focus more on.

6. As a student who enjoys using software to keep track of my study progress, I want to be able to keep track of all my study progress on one single application.

7. As a user of Forest but not a huge fan of trees, I would like a similar app with a different theme and more functionality.
